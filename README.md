# sejda-crack
Sejda PDF Desktop crack for Mac tested on version 7.8.1 and old.

## Requirements
Before you start, make sure you have the following requirements:
- You have Python installed. If not, download and install it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- You have Sejda PDF Desktop installed. If not, download it from [here](https://www.sejda.com/desktop), install it **and launch it at least once**.

### Running the script as root on Linux and Mac
- Open a terminal.
- Use the cd command to navigate to the directory containing the script.
- Execute the script with the following command `sudo python3 sejda-crack.py`.

#### Disabling Sejda's access to the internet 
- At launch, Sejda Pro will appear first, but will later appear as a free trial.
- The built-in firewall in the Mac operating system only blocks incoming connections and does not work very effectively.
- For this reason, unlike the Windows operating system, 3rd party firewall applications are preferred for Mac OS. LuLu is at the top of the list.
- You can download the LuLu firewall software from this link [here](https://objective-see.org/products/lulu.html)
- To install LuLu, first download the installation file containing the application. Then double-click LuLu.dmg and drag LuLu.app to the Applications folder
- After copying LuLu to the Applications folder, start the program to continue the installation.
- Authorize the application by following the instructions that follow.
- Afterwards, you will block the Sejda App from accessing the internet by adding a new rule via LuLu.
